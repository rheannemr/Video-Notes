# U Notes

U Notes is a video note taking full-stack application created with React.js, MongoDB, and Auth0. The user can search videos, take notes as they are watching the video, and save all of that together for future reference. Using the Youtube Data API, users have access to all videos on the platform. When creating notes, the user is able to log the time of the video so they can easily find the exact elapsed time that the note was created. The user must log in or create an account to begin using U Notes; Once the user is logged in, they are able to save data to their personal account and retrieve it at any given time.
